## Hello, RC here

I am a software developer living in Seattle. I build products and maintain systems at [Pro.com](https://pro.com)

This site contains links to my blog posts where I try to document my experiences with building frontend and backend applications. You should also find a list of projects that I author and contribute to.

My current interests include OSS, Ruby, React, TypeScript, Rust, Performance and Design.

If you'd like to get in contact, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rcdexta) or [Github](https://github.com/rcdexta).

Thanks for visiting my site. Cheers!
