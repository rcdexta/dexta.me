## Hello, RC here

I am a software developer living in Seattle, building systems at [Pro.com](https://pro.com)

I have been fiddling with computers since I got my first Intel x386/MS-DOS 6.22/Win 3.1 PC when I was 10 years old. My first programming language was Pascal and the first program that I was proud of writing was a Sudoku solver! Nothing gives me the kicks like building a concept from an idea blip to a fully functional system! 

My current interests include Open Source, Ruby, React, TypeScript, Rust and Design.

If you'd like to get in contact, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rcdexta) or [Github](https://github.com/rcdexta)

Thanks for visiting my site. Cheers!
