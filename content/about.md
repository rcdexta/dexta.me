## Who am I?

I am Ramachandran (RC) and I am a Full Stack Maker at [Pro.com](https://pro.com) where we use technology to streamline residential construction process.

I also contribute and maintain several open source software that you should find links to on the Projects page.

My current interests include OSS, Ruby, React, TypeScript, Rust, Performance and Design.

## What do I do?

I have been fiddling with computers since I got my first Intel x386/MS-DOS 6.22/Win 3.1 PC when I was 10 years old. My first programming language was Pascal and the first program that I was proud of writing was a Sudoku solver!

Nothing gives me the kicks like building a concept from an idea blip to a fully functional system! My current interests include Open Source, Ruby, React, TypeScript, DevOps, Performance and Design.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/rcdexta), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rcdexta), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1385252/dexter), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramachandran-r-00177715/) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@rcdexta)
